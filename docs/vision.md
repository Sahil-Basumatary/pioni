# Vision

Pioni is a tool for people who want to make sense of financial markets without spending years learning technical analysis or subscribing to expensive platforms. The goal is to bridge the gap between what hedge funds can access and what students, early professionals, and independent retail traders have available.

Instead of relying on traditional financial metrics alone, Pioni looks at what people are talking about(the trend), reacting to, and feeling. Markets move because of narratives, fear, excitement and not solely on earnings and this project is built around that truth.

Pioni takes real-time signals from news, social media platforms, and public sentiment, and turns them into fast, visual insights. The interface is very simple intentionally in that it is a swipe-based decision model inspired by fast consumer apps, paired with deeper analysis behind each card for users who want more context.

The long-term goal to help users understand how emotion interacts with money, and to give them an accessible way to see patterns that are usually hidden in the overwhelming spreadsheets and trading algorithms.

This project will grow in stages, starting with an MVP that focuses on clear, digestible signals. As it evolves, the plan is to move towards more dynamic, personalised intelligence.
