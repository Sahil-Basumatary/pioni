# Problem Statement

Retail traders and early-career investors currently have two choices:

1. Use professional tools that are expensive and designed for experts.
2. Use simple apps that hide real insight behind basic graphs and charts.

Neither option gives everyday users access to the kind of intelligence that actually makes a difference

There is no lightweight, intuitive product that translates public behaviour into actionable signals for humans — not algorithms, not institutional trading desks, but real people who make decisions daily.

Current platforms either overwhelm beginners with complexity or oversimplify information to the point of being unhelpful. Meanwhile, the tools that combine sentiment, real-time social data, and market context exist either almost exclusively inside hedge funds or research labs or are not reliable. 

Pioni will solve that. It will be reliable, fast and practical.
