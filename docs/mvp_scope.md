# MVP Scope

The MVP will not try to solve everything at once. It will focus on a single clear outcome for now

> Give the user a quick, intuitive signal based on real-time sentiment around selected stocks.

### The MVP will include:

- A basic interface where the user selects or swipes through a set of stocks.
- A sentiment score pulled from live or recent public sources starting with reddit posts and news headlines
- A confidence indicator (e.g. strong, moderate, weak signal).
- A minimal explanation panel showing where the signal came from.
- Ability to track selected stocks and update sentiment periodically.

### Out of scope for MVP:

- Full trading integrations
- Custom portfolios
- Price prediction models
- Crypto or forex support
- Push notification systems
- User login and authentication

The focus of this version is simplicity and clarity at the same time.
